The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to data fetching and asynchronous operations:

```javascript
// Incorrect asynchronous data handling
db.ref('users').once('value', (snapshot) => {
  const userData = snapshot.val();
  // Attempting to use userData outside the scope of the callback
  console.log(userData.name); // This might cause an error
});

console.log('This line executes before data is fetched'); //This will execute before the data is fetched from the server
```
This occurs because Firebase's data retrieval methods are asynchronous. The `once()` method fetches data from the database asynchronously. If you attempt to access `userData` before the data has been fetched, the code will result in undefined or a similar error.
